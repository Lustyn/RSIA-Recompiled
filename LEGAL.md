# Legal FAQs and Disclaimers

## Is this legal?

[**IANAL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL),[^1] but in many countries **I believe yes**. Please consult your local laws if you are concerned.

## Why is this (probably) legal?

This repository does not redistribute the games code or assets[^2], and merely applies patches on small sections of the game, supplied by the user. I am not currently and will not share copyrighted materials for the sake of this project.

## I'm a representative from Jagex or Hyper Hippo and I don't like this, what can I do?

Firstly, I'd ask nicely that you *don't* attempt to immediately take this repo down, as it is not intended to and will not affect your business. You can contact me via the email found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Lustyn). I would be happy to talk through this project and why I believe this game history relic should be available offline.


[^1]: I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.
