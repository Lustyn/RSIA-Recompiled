## Requirements

Building this project requires you have the following tools installed and added to your PATH:

- [ðŸ’¾ `ilspycmd`](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/tree/master/ICSharpCode.Decompiler.Console) (tested with version 7.1.0.0)
- [ðŸ’¾ `git`](https://git-scm.com/)
- [ðŸ’¾ `Visual Studio / msbuild`](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (tested with VS2019)

## Preparations ([Why?](LEGAL.md))

It is necessary that you have a copy of the two key items:

- A copy of the games files downloaded from [ðŸ’¾ Steam](steam://install/452780). ([SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/app/452780/))
- A copy of the games web assets downloaded from the CDN. (tested with version [ðŸ’¾ `0.1.9`](ASSETS-0.1.9.txt))

The files should be placed in the project directory like so:

    README.md (you are here)
    data/
    â”œâ”€ idle-adventures.exe
    â”œâ”€ idle-adventures_data/
    â”‚  â”œâ”€ Managed/
    â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ Assembly-CSharp.dll
    â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ [...]
    â”‚  â”œâ”€ StreamingAssets/
    â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ win32/
    â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ art/
    â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ data/
    â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ scenes/
    â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ win32

Note that the StreamingAssets directory does not usually exist, you will have to create it and drop in the assets you acquired from the CDN.

## Building

First, decompile and apply the patches to the games code:

    gradlew applyPatches

Next, build the game:

    gradlew build

The final game data will be copied to the `build` directory. Simply copy this over your Steam installation or use your favorite â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ.
